# ðŸŽ¨ Distinct Color Explorer

An interactive app to explore named colors based on HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) values using [TheColorAPI](https://www.thecolorapi.com/). Built with React, this app emphasizes performance, progressive rendering, and visual feedback.

## ðŸš€ Running the Project Locally

1. **Clone the repo**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kgolder92/color-swatches-take-home.git
   cd color-swatches-take-home
2. **Install dependencies and Start the development server**
   ```bash
    npm install
    npm start
3. **Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000**

## ðŸ“• Overview
The goal of this project was to build a performant and user-friendly interface if HSL color swatches that takes in user inputs for saturation (s) and lightness(l), and renders a single swatch for each of the distinct hue names for the given S and L values from the API.
A key part of this challenge was avoiding unecessary API requests

## ðŸ§  Technologies Used
- React (with hooks)
- SCSS Modules
- TheColorAPI
- lodash.debounce for input debouncing

## âœ¨ Design Decisions
When building this project, I focused on creating a smooth and satisfying user experience while keeping performance top of mind. As users tweak the saturation and lightness values, a custom debounced hook ensures we donâ€™t overload the API with unnecessary calls. Behind the scenes, I used a binary search over the hue spectrum, jumping only to points likely to have distinct named colors which cuts down on redundant requests.
Visually, I wanted the interface to feel alive and responsive. Colors render progressively as theyâ€™re fetched, giving immediate feedback rather than making users wait. To keep things polished, I added skeleton cards as placeholders to maintain layout consistency and signal that more is loading. A color counter updates in real time, even changing its color to match the latest fetched swatch. And once the loading is complete, a cheerful toast lets users know theyâ€™re all set. All of these details come together to make exploring color feel quick, intuitive, and a little delightful.

## ðŸ§  Future Improvements
cacheing to reduce api calls even more
optimization like cleaning up unused dependencies and such
Allow exporting or saving color palettes (would be fun)

### Other
- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
- I ended up doing most of the take-home in one go and didnâ€™t make intermediate commits â€” something I absolutely avoid on a production team. In hindsight, I should have broken things up more clearly. If itâ€™s helpful, Iâ€™d be happy to walk through my thinking
